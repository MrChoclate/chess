gui.py

This module contains the code necessary to have a graphical interface
(if chosen).  It relies on pyQt. The idea is to simply print the state
of game (and the game log if needed for instance), to get user inputs,
say a menu action, and to interact with the core modules to tell'em to
modify the game state for example.
