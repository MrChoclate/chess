The main goal of this project is to create a chess game.

The player could play versus a human or an AI.
The player could also watch an AI vs AI, save a game and rewatch a finished
game.

A network interface should be designed allowing the game to be played on
2 machines.

There should be a menu bar on the top whith the following options:
Game: New game, Save game, Load game.
Edit: Undo, redo.
View: ✓ Classic display..., ✓ Display history
Help: Help

The history will be displayed on the the right of the board.
Timers will be displayed up and down the board.
Taked pieces will be displayed near the timers.

Saved games are stored in a directory named saves.
The differents AI are stored in a directory named AI.

At the end of each game, it will be asked if the player want to save the game.
